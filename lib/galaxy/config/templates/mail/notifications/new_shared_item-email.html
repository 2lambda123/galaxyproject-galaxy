Use this template to customize the HTML email your users will receive
when a new notification of category "new_shared_item" is sent to them.
Copy the file to {{ templates_dir }}/mail/notifications/new_shared_item-email.html and modify as required.

If you are adding URLs into this, remember that only absolute URLS (with
a domain name) make sense in email! They can be served from any stable
location, including your Galaxy server or GitHub.

the email is sent:

- user_email                The user's email
- date                      Date and time of the notification

- contact_email             Your galaxy's contact email
- notification_settings_url The URL to the user's notification settings to manage their subscriptions
- content                   The new_shared_item payload
  - item_type               The type of the shared item
  - item_name               The name of the shared item
  - owner_name              The name of the owner of the shared item
  - slug                    The slug of the shared item. Used for the link to the item.
