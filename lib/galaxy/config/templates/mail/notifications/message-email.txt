Use this template to customize the text email your users will receive
when a new notification of category "message" is sent to them.
Copy the file to {{ templates_dir }}/mail/notifications/message-email.txt and modify as required.

If you are adding URLs into this, remember that only absolute URLS (with
a domain name) make sense in email! They can be served from any stable
location, including your Galaxy server or GitHub.

The following variables are available for inserting into the text like
{{ variable_name }}. They will be rendered into the text before the email is
sent:

- name                      The user's name
- user_email                The user's email
- date                      Date and time of the notification
- hostname                  Your galaxy's hostname
- contact_email             Your galaxy's contact email
- notification_settings_url The URL to the user's notification settings to manage their subscriptions
- content                   The message payload
  - subject                 The message subject
  - content                 The message content in HTML (converted from Markdown)
