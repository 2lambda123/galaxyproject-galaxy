### Aspirational Principles of Galaxy Architecture

Whereas the architecture of the frontend (Web UI) aims for consistency and is
highly opinionated, the backend (Python server) is guided by flexibility and is meant to be driven by plugins whenever possible.

???

Though an imperfect abstraction... maybe it is beneficial to think of the organizational
principles that guide frontend and backend development of Galaxy as
diametrically opposite.

The frontend architecture is guided by the principle that the end user experience
should be as simple and consistent as possible. The backend has been deployed at
so many different sites and targetting so many different technologies - that 
flexibility is paramount.

---

### An Opinionated Frontend

- The target audience is a bench scientist - no knowledge of programming, paths, or command lines should be assumed.
- Consistent colors, fonts, themes, etc...
- Reusable libraris for presenting common widgets such as forms and grids.
- Tied to specific technologies:
  - JavaScript driven.
  - Backbone for MVC.
  - RequireJS for module loading.

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend

A deployer of Galaxy can plug

---

### A Plugin Driven Backend but...

Galaxy has long been guided by the principle that cloning it and calling
the `run.sh` should "just work" and should work quickly.

So by default Galaxy does not require:

 - Compilation - it fetches binary wheels.
 - A job manager - Galaxy can act as one.
 - An external database server - Galaxy can use an sqlite database.
 - A web proxy or external Python web server.

## Galaxy Models

- Database interactions powered by SQLAlchemy - http://www.sqlalchemy.org/.
- Galaxy doesn't think in terms "rows" but "objects".
- Classes for Galaxy model objects in `lib/galaxy/model/__init__.py`.
- Classes mapped to objects in `lib/galaxy/model/mapping.py`
  - Describes table definitions and relationships.

## Galaxy Model Migrations

- A migration describes a linear list of database "diff"s to
  end up with the current Galaxy model.
- Allow the schema to be migrated forward automatically.
- Powered by sqlalchemy-migrate - https://sqlalchemy-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
- Each file in `lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/`
  - `0124_job_state_history.py`
  - `0125_workflow_step_tracking.py`
  - `0126_password_reset.py`

## 3. Galaxy components and object model

---

Galaxy data model is not database entity driven

Entities are defined in galaxy.model as objects

SQLAlchemy is used for object relation mapping

Mappings are defined in galaxy.model.mapping in two
<br />
parts - a table definition and a mapping between
<br />
objects and table including relationships

Migrations allow the schema to be migrated forward
<br />
automatically

### Core components

---

### Core components: run analysis
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/run_analysis.png)

---

### Metadata
Structured data

Different keys/types for different datatypes

Can be used by tools to dynamically control the
<br />
tool form

---

### Core components: workflow

### Data Libraries

---

### Reference data "cache"
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/data_cache.png)

---

### .special2[Visualization Plugins]

Adding new visualizatons to a Galaxy instance:
- Configuration file (XML)
- Base template (Mako)
- Additional static data *if needed* (CSS, JS, ...)

---

### .special2[Visualization Plugins: Charts]
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/viz_plugin_charts.png)

---

### .special2[Visualization Plugins: Data]

How do I *efficiently* access data for my viz?
- Framework provides direct link to read the raw dataset
- *or* use Data providers
    - In config, assert that visualization requires a given type of data provider
    - Data providers process data before sending to browser. Slice, filter, reformat, ...

---

### .special2[Interactive Environments]
Galaxy side is identical to interactive
<br />
environments: config and base template
- Within the base template, launch a Docker container running a web accessible process
- Build a UI that accesses that process through a proxy

---

### .special2[Dataset Collections]
Hundreds or **thousands** of similar datasets are
<br />
unwiedly, how do you get a handle on them?
- Group datasets into a single unit
- Perform complex operations on that unit
    - Operations are performed on each group element
    - Output of each operation is a new group

---

### First run: Initialize configs

---

### First run: Fetch eggs
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Every run: Load the application
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Every run: Load database migrations

---

Everything after here happens every time

---

### Load tool migrations
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load datatypes
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load datatypes sniffers
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load build (display) sites
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load data tables
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Read job configuration file
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)
* config/job_conf.xml will automatically be read if created, see
<br />
job_conf_xml.sample_advanced for fully documented examples of all
<br />
possible configurations

---

### Load tools
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)
* shed_tool_conf.xml is empty on the first run so
<br />
only tools provided with Galaxy are loaded, but
<br />
after tools are installed from the Tool Shed, they
<br />
will load here

---

### Associate display apps with datatypes
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load implicit datatype converters
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)
* A few internal operations are defined as tools to allow them to run via Galaxy'
<br />
s job system, and are loaded here as well

---

### Load visualization plugins
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Initialize job handlers
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Initialize web controllers
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

### Load WSGI middleware
![Default-aligned image](images/galaxy_components/object_store2.png)

---

serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080

---

## 5. A Galaxy request

---

### Beginning of request
- TCP connection from client on port 80
- WSGI server is responsible for picking up the
<br />
connection, parsing HTTP headers, and
<br />
reformatting them into a dictionary according
<br />
to the WSGI spec, this dict is called "environ"
- In a default Galaxy install this is *currently*
Paste#http

---

### Middleware
- The WSGI interface is based around function
<br />
calls: def app( environ, start_response ): ...
- Middleware act as filters, modify the environ
<br />
and then pass through to the next webapp
- Galaxy uses several middleware components
galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp#wrap_in_middleware
<br />
error handling, logging, proxy hostname, debug, static, ...

---

### WebApplication (galaxy.web.framework.base#WebApplication)
- Galaxy's custom web framework, shares a lot
<br />
of ideas with Pylons
- __call__ method supports the WSGI spec
    - Takes environ and creates a wrapper object
    <br />
    GalaxyWebTransaction -- ** this is the ubiquitous trans! **
