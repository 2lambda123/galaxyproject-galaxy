This document contains some wisdom regarding the DRMAA library development.

SPECIFICATIONS:
The work so far was developed by the following two specifications:
 Distributed Resource Management Application API Specification 1.0 January 2004
 DRMAA C Bindings v1.0

Both are available at www.drmaa.org.

FILES:
  The library is organized into 4 files: libDrmaa.c and its corresponding
header file and auxDrmaa.c and its header.  
  libDrmaa.h - contains the DRMAA API as specified in C Bindings v1.0	
  libDrmaa.c - main implementation of libDrmaa.h
  auxDrmaa.h - contains global constants, #defines, etc. for library
  auxDrmaa.c - contains auxiliary methods of libDrmaa.c

DESIGN IN A NUTSHELL:
Aside from the complexity required by the individual API functions, there are
only a few extras in the library. The library maintains one lock that guards
its initialization status and one linked lists of job information. The list
is also guarded by a lock.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Multiple "return"s.  This code has many cases, many of which require immediate
exit, ie. no further processing of function's parameters.  Disadvantage: not
the most straightforward to read.
- Use of log files.  Jobs are run by popen()ing condor_submit with a certain
submit file.  _wait(), _synchronize() and other functions rely heavily on
Condor's log files.  (Alternatives include asking Condor via condor_q, etc.)

TODO:
  See STATUS document.

RUNNING TESTS (UWSC internal):
 - copy files for test401, test402

STATUS CODE of drmaa_wait():
  |-- (-1) -- 0 ---- 1 ---------------------- 101 -------------------- 200 ---|
     abort  unknown signal                   signal & core            normal
  case 1: normal exit: add 200 to exit value, 200 <= stat <= 456
  case 2: exit via signal: 1 <= stat <= 99; contains no exit() result info 
  case 3: exit via signal with core dump: add 100 to signal value, 101 <= stat <= 199; 
          contains no exit() result info 
  case 4: unknown: set status code to 0; contains no exit() result info 
  case 5: aborted: set status code to -1; contains no exit() result info
